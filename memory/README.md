# Memory

Stores information across and during tasks. Can include:

- JIT prompts
- World model fragments (object location, room map)
- Short-term memory (task context, intermediate results)
- Long-term skill usage patterns

Memory enables contextual reasoning, personalization, and short-term task coherence.
